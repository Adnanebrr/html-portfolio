                <h2>Summary:</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I’m Adnane Birrouz, a 25-year-old from Morocco with a background in economic studies and a passion for software engineering. I speak four languages—Arabic, French, English, and German—which helps me collaborate effectively across cultures and teams.<br>
                    My analytical mindset from economics now fuels my work in front-end development, where I’m focused on building clean, intuitive user experiences. My goal is to grow into a full-stack developer, and I’m actively expanding my skills on both ends of the tech stack.<br>
                    I’m looking for a company that values growth, mentorship, and innovation, where I can contribute meaningfully while continuing to learn and improve. I’d love to bring my skills and energy to your team and help move your projects forward. </p>
